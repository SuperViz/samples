# Sample Room for Who Is Online (React/JS)

The Autodesk plugin from SuperViz SDK is designed to seamlessly integrate avatars, mouse-pointers, lasers, and host controls into your digital twin tool.

### SuperViz SDK

This project hosts samples for SuperViz SDK. To find out more about the SDK itself, please visit [the documentation](https://docs.superviz.com/).

The SDK documentation has extensive sections about [getting started](https://docs.superviz.com/getting-started/quickstart), setting up the SDK, as well as the process of acquiring the required developer key.

## Build and run the samples

You can run this sample with npm:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

or with Yarn:

```bash
yarn install
yarn start
```

Just make sure that you have the required developer keys in the `.env` file. For that copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in the values.

You will need Developer Key keys to run the samples on your machines, you therefore should [follow the instructions on these pages](https://docs.superviz.com/getting-started/setting-account) before continuing.
